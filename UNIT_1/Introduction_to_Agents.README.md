## 📖 What is an AI Agent? 🤖

Imagine you have a personal assistant named **Aiden**. You say: 

> “Aiden, I need you to book a flight to Paris and organize my travel itinerary.” ✈️🗼

Aiden understands your request in natural language and starts planning. To achieve the task, Aiden needs to:

1. **Search for available flights.**
2. **Book the most suitable flight.**
3. **Find the best hotels.**
4. **Create a detailed itinerary for your trip.**

Aiden can do all of this because it's not just a chatbot – it’s an **AI Agent**, with the ability to:

- ✅ **Understand** your instructions.
- 🔍 **Plan** how to achieve the task.
- 🔨 **Act** by interacting with various tools and services.

## 🧠 How AI Agents Work

An AI Agent has two main components:

### 1. The Brain (AI Model)
The brain of the agent is usually a **Large Language Model (LLM)**, like **LLaMA, GPT-4, or Gemini**. It’s responsible for **thinking, planning, and deciding** what actions to take. 

### 2. The Body (Tools & Actions)
The body represents everything the Agent can **do**. It could be a set of predefined tools like:

- 🔑 **Web Search**
- 📧 **Send Email**
- 📅 **Create Calendar Events**
- 📞 **Make API Calls**

The more tools the Agent has, the broader its capabilities.

## 🔍 How Do AI Agents Take Actions? 

AI Agents can only **generate text by themselves**, but they achieve amazing results by using **Tools**. 

For example, when you ask **Aiden** to book a flight, the LLM generates a command to interact with a flight-booking API:

```python
def book_flight(destination, date, budget):
    """Books a flight based on destination, date, and budget."""
    # Connect to flight booking API
    # Fetch available flights
    # Book the most suitable flight
    return f"Flight to {destination} on {date} booked within budget of ${budget}!"
