# AI Agents Repository

Welcome to the **AI Agents Repository**! 🚀

This repository serves as a dedicated space for learning, understanding, and documenting the **theory and foundational concepts of AI Agents**. It will cover theoretical aspects, frameworks, and descriptions of AI Agents using various established libraries.

## 📌 What is this Repository About?
This repository aims to provide:
- An introduction to AI Agents and their core concepts.
- Theoretical understanding of popular AI Agent libraries like **smolagents**, **LangGraph**, and **LlamaIndex**.
- Explanations of different use cases to showcase real-world applications of AI Agents.
- Tutorials and explanations for building and deploying AI Agents (in theory).

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository will be structured as follows:

```
├── foundational_concepts/      # Theory and core concepts of AI Agents
├── frameworks/                 # Descriptions of popular frameworks (smolagents, LangGraph, LlamaIndex)
├── use_cases/                  # Explanations of practical use cases and AI Agent applications
├── models/                     # Pre-trained and fine-tuned model descriptions
├── README.md                   # Introduction to the repository (You are here)
```

## 📚 Topics Covered
